🎯 **Senior Data Engineer | Snowflake | Databricks | Airflow | Python**

I'm a results-driven Data Engineer with over 7 years of experience designing and scaling high-performance, cost-efficient data solutions. I specialize in cloud data platforms like **Snowflake** and **Databricks**, workflow orchestration with **Apache Airflow**, and large-scale data pipelines using **Python** and **SQL**.

I'm currently working at **Turing** (Kiavi), where I focus on:
- 💸 **Saved $20k+/year** by optimizing Snowflake upserts and improving storage/query performance  
- 🔄 **Migrated 100+ data pipelines** to Airflow 2 using reusable, standardized code that reduced maintenance and enforced best practices  
- 🛎️ **Built an early-warning system** for data warehouse schema changes—integrated with CI/CD and issue tracking tools  
- 📊 **Enhanced data quality and reliability** by introducing automated validations and increasing dataset coverage through robust transformations  
- 🧰 **Developed a CLI toolkit** to automate repetitive engineering tasks like table syncing, metadata extraction, and dataset testing  
- 🧠 **Improved data observability** by refining alert logic and schema ownership in a monitoring platform  
- 🔐 **Centralized secret management** using a secure vault and automated environment configuration for streamlined onboarding  
- 📬 **Automated large-scale data exports and reports**, reducing manual effort and increasing delivery consistency  
- 📚 **Produced in-depth documentation** that accelerated onboarding and standardized data engineering practices across the team  

I thrive in fully remote, global teams and am passionate about building scalable, well-documented systems that align technical excellence with real business impact.
